## Synopsis

obsgetter is the test out project assigned for CS235. It is a command line application that retrieves weather reports from Government Weather site](http://w1.weather.gov).

## Building
Running "make" will generate the obsgetter application. Running "make doc" will generate a Word DOCX document from the markdown SDD.

## Installation

Not currently an available target. The executable is intended to be run from the local directory. The path itself doesn't matter, but it needs a weather.cfg available within the folder to know how to output the weather information.

## Tests

None currently. As no license is chosen yet, I could not find a decent header only C unit test library to utilize. Implementing my own would have required more effort than I could afford. Testing is ad-hoc and manual.

## License

Undetermined.
